# PHPCheckstyle

This is a work in progress to make PHPCheckstyle use an AST parser. It'll most likely end up being a complete rewrite, supporting good standards out of the box (as a default).

The goal is to make PHPCheckstyle the PHP version of [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop).

## TODO

- [ ] Integrate PHP-Parser.
- [ ] Set default standards to [PSR 2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).
- [ ] Run as a binary with console output and as a library. #46
- [ ] Switch to [semver](http://semver.org) versioning. #42
- [ ] Create a proper test suite. #18
